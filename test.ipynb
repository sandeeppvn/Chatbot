The long \\ncherished dream has been realized through the benevolence of  Danaseela,  \\nPurapramukha  and  Vidya -Poshaka  Sri Kakaraparti  Bhavanarayana  \\nShresti.  The foundation stone of the college was laid on 6th November, 1964 \\nby Sri Kasu Brahmananda Reddy, the then Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. \\nThe college was constructed on 4.1 1 acres of land of the  S.K.P.V.V.  Hindu  \\nHigh  Schools’  Committee. It commenced functioning fully ever since July, \\n1965. The college had a humble beginning with 278 students and a devoted \\nstaff of just nineteen under the visionary leadership of the Founder P rincipal \\nSri S. Sundaram.  \\nThe infrastructure of the college is admirable. The college has a state of the \\nart library with a digital library and a spacious reading room. The college is \\nembellished with expansive playgrounds and a well -\\nequipped  Gymnasium.  The college is also endowed with an elegantly \\ndesigned open air theatre,  Kalanikethan  with an open gallery and a seating \\ncapacity of 2500, which is one of the spectacular features of the college. Our \\ncollege emblem symbolizes the noble ideals for which our i nstitution stands. \\nThe sunrays, the book and the illuminating lamp, all represent the divine \\nattributes which aim at dispelling darkness and spreading light. The \\nmotto  “Thejasvina  Vadhitamastu”  a part of our daily prayer, truly \\nexpresses our pious wish. “L et the Divine Deity help us to carry on our \\n“Adhyayana” that bestows luster on us both.  \\nEversince its inception in 1965,the College is known for its relentless striving \\ntowards transforming the student into an enlightened citizen.
